# automate-business-routines
A handy script that facilitates and automates the downloading of excel reports

## Informations

* Based on Python (3.8.5) 

## Usage

Use this script in order to download batches of excel files that need to be merged and put into specific folders.
These excel files might be some reports that need to be downloaded on a regular basis* (e.g. daily, weekly, etc.) from a server.
So instead of merging these batches of excel files manually, the script takes care of that automatically.
The script will also move the merged excel files into specific hardcoded folders.

 \* Depending on how frequently the reports should be downloaded, you can make very few changes in the code.
